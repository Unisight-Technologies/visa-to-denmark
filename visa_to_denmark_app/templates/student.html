                    <p>Visa interview is the moment where you meet with the consular officer directly as a visa applicant. The same time you need to present all the visa required documents, as your consular officer asks for them orderly. During a

                    <p>Foreigners who seek to remain in Germany for more than 90 DAYS or 3 MONTHS you need to possess the proper residence title. In our case a Residence Permit “Aufenthaltsgenehmigung” is the appropriate title, intended for study
                      purposes. A residence permit will be issued only upon the application of the visa holder at the Alien Registration Office “Ausländerbehörde“ in the city where your university is located.</p>

                      <li>Bear in mind that the incomplete visa application can be refused</li>
                      <li>Do not stick your photographs in the visa application form</li>
                      <li>Don’t take anyone with you to the Embassy or Consulate during a visa interview</li>
                      <li>Every applicant is authorised to take legal actions against the embassy or consulate decision on her/his visa application</li>
                      <li>Getting your Visa For Study Purposes is important, instead of a Tourist Visa -because it gives you the opportunity to get a residence permit once in Germany REMEMBER that a Tourist Visa cannot be extended further while in
                        Germany, in case you need to stay longer!</li>
                      <li>If the applicant is considered to represent a risk for the security and public order of the Schengen Area the visa will be rejected
                        In case of visa rejection the applicant gets informed about the main reason of rejection</li>
                      <li>Make sure for your trip to Germany to be scheduled early enough so you will have the needed time in disposition to enrol in university</li>

                      <li>Germany study visa is not automatically given – so you have to wait for up to 4 MONTHS to get a response from the Embassy or Consulate and there is no guarantee you will be granted with a visa</li>
                      <li>The application form can be downloaded freely on the website of the Embassy or Consulate in your country</li>
                      <li>The passport remains at the Embassy / Consulate during the entire process of visa proceeding</li>
